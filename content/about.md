Hi, I'm Jeremy Jung. 

I'm having conversations about software development with folks to hear their practical experiences and stories.  If you prefer reading, I'm collecting notes, transcripts, and articles based on these conversations.

If this is helpful to you or you have any suggestions, please [let me know](mailto:contact@softwaresessions.com).
